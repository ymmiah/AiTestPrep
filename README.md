-   **Enhancement:** Added a consistent header and footer across all modules of the application for a more unified user experience.
-   **Feature:** The new global footer includes a direct link to the project's GitHub repository and displays the date of the last update.

**October 19, 2025:**
-   **Feature:** Implemented a full, realistic **B1 GESE Grade 5 Mock Exam**.
    -   **Official Structure:** The test follows the official 10-minute, two-part format, starting with a 5-minute **Topic Phase** based on user-provided notes, followed by a 5-minute **Conversation Phase** with an AI examiner.
    -   **Timed Experience:** A 10-minute countdown timer simulates real exam conditions and helps users practice time management.
    -   **Realistic Setup & Interaction:** Users begin by setting up their chosen topic and key points, just like in the real test. The AI acts strictly as an examiner, asking questions without providing feedback until the end.
    -   **Comprehensive Final Assessment:** After the test, users receive a detailed performance review, including an overall outcome (Clear Pass, Pass, or Fail) and specific feedback on communicative effectiveness, language control, and pronunciation.
    -   **Transcript Review:** A full transcript of the test is available for review.

## üöÄ Getting Started

This project runs entirely in the browser with no build step required.

### Prerequisites

-   A modern web browser that supports the Web Speech API (e.g., Google Chrome).
-   A Google Gemini API key.

### Installation & Setup

**1. Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ymmiah/AiTestPrep.git
cd AiTestPrep
```

**2. Set Up Your API Key**

The application is designed to be run in an environment where the API key is securely provided as an environment variable (`process.env.API_KEY`), such as the AI Studio Builder environment.

To run the project locally, you must simulate this environment:

-   Create a new file named `config.js` in the root of the project.
-   Add the following code to `config.js`, replacing `"YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"` with your actual key:

    ```javascript
    // config.js
    window.process = {
      env: {
        API_KEY: "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE",
      }
    };
    ```

-   In `index.html`, add a script tag for this new file inside the `<head>` tag, **before** the main script (`/index.tsx`):

    ```html
    <head>
      ...
      <script src="/config.js"></script>
      <script type="importmap">
      ...
    </head>
    ```

> **Security Note:** The `config.js` file should **never** be committed to version control. Ensure your `.gitignore` file includes a line for `config.js`.

**3. Run a Local Server**

Serve the project's root directory using any static file server. A simple method is to use Python's built-in HTTP server:

```bash
# If you have Python 3 installed
python -m http.server
```

**4. Open in Browser**

Navigate to the local address provided by your server (e.g., `http://localhost:8000`).

---

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment

Deploy this application on any static hosting provider (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages).

When deploying, you must set an **Environment Variable** in your hosting provider's project settings:

-   **Name:** `API_KEY`
-   **Value:** `YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY`

The platform's build system will securely make this variable available to the application at runtime.
